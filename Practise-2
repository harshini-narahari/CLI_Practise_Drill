#Command for listing our browser's process ids (pid) and parent process ids(ppid)
ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd | grep chrome               # ps -e lists all processes and pid - Process id, ppid - parent process id , cmd - command used to start process 

#command for stop the browser application from the command line
killall chrome                       # killall stops alll instances of a specific process

#Command for listing the top 3 processes by CPU usage.
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -n 4              #%cpu indicates cpu usage percentage by each process.--sort=-%cpu used to sort the processes by CPU usage in descending order. head -n 4 gives top 3 cpu usages processes

#Command for listing the top 3 processes by memory usage.
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem --sort=-%mem | head -n 4              #%mem indicates memory usage percatage by each process.

#Command for starting a Python HTTP server on port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000                            # starts a simple HTTP server on port 8000, which is the default port used by this example.

# Open another tab. Stop the process you started in the previous step
pkill -f "python3 -m http.server 8000"

#Command for Starting a Python HTTP server on port 90
sudo python3 -m http.server 90                      #we use sudo for Port numbers below 1024 because they are considered privileged ports and require superuser (root) privileges to bind to them.

#Command for Displaying all active connections and the corresponding TCP / UDP ports.
sudo apt-get install net-tools                      #-t: Show TCP connections, -u: Show UDP connections, -l: Show listening sockets (active ports) , -n: Show numerical addresses and ports (without resolving domain names).
netstat -tuln

#Comamnd for finding the pid of the process that is listening on port 5432
netstat -tuln | grep ':5432'                        #netstat -tuln lists all TCP/UDP connections and listening ports along with their respective PIDs. and grep ':5432' filters the output to show only port 5432
